This literature review examines recent research on the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate and edit Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs). The review synthesizes findings from several studies to address whether LLMs can generate SVGs and explores the methods used.

Recent advancements in image generation using diffusion and autoregressive models have been applied to SVG creation (Rodriguez et al., 2023). However, these approaches often face challenges such as overfitting on complex SVG datasets and slow processing due to their iterative nature. To address these limitations, researchers have begun exploring the use of LLMs for SVG generation and editing.

One key advantage of using LLMs for SVG processing is that SVG files are text-based (XML format), allowing LLMs to handle them directly without the need for complex image generation models (Nishina & Matsui, 2024). This approach simplifies the process and potentially enables more intuitive interfaces for vector graphics editing through text-based interactions.

Several studies have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in SVG generation and editing:

1. IconShop: This research utilized a BERT model for text-to-SVG conversion, focusing specifically on icons. The model was trained using path commands as tokens (Rodriguez et al., 2023).

2. StarVector: This study proposed a novel approach to SVG modeling, developing a model capable of generating unrestricted SVG code. The model focuses on directly rendering vector graphics within the SVG code space, bypassing constraints of previous methodologies (Rodriguez et al., 2023).

3. SVG-driven image understanding: Cai et al. (2023) explored leveraging LLMs for scalable vector graphics-driven image understanding, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in processing and interpreting SVG content.

4. Human-readable SVG generation: Zhang et al. (2023) investigated the use of vision language models for generating human-readable SVG code for simple images, highlighting the potential for more interpretable and logical representations of graphical elements.

While these studies show promising results, Nishina and Matsui (2024) noted that much of the existing research provides examples without quantitatively demonstrating LLMs' capabilities in handling various SVG editing tasks. To address this gap, they developed a benchmark dataset called SVGEditBench to quantitatively evaluate LLMs' SVG editing capabilities.

The potential benefits of using LLMs for SVG generation and editing include:

1. Direct handling of SVG files without the need for complex image generation models.
2. Possibility of intuitive text-based interfaces for vector graphics editing.
3. Improved interpretability and logical representation of graphical elements.

However, challenges remain in combining LLMs with advanced image generation models and quantitatively assessing their performance across a wide range of SVG editing tasks.

In conclusion, while research demonstrates that LLMs can indeed generate and edit SVGs, further investigation is needed to fully understand their capabilities and limitations in this domain. The development of benchmark datasets like SVGEditBench will be crucial in advancing this field and providing more comprehensive evaluations of LLM performance in SVG-related tasks.
